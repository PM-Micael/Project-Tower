- Eneemies collide with tower (keep?)

2025-12-13	
	Question:
			- Do I want to spawn in turrets during scene runtime or just upgrade them?

	Notes
		- Tower tiers will work in layers and start with 3 walls
		- Player can set a "watchpoint" to somewhat control where the canons will shoot.

	- Make waves and spawning work properly
	- Investigate the delay in canons shoting when round starts
	- Display current tier and round on the UI
	
	Notes
		- Skins would be cool.

	- Figure out how I want to handle maps.
	- Perhaps make a test map.
	
	Notes
		- As your fort grows it opens up possebility for more pawn locations for difficulity
