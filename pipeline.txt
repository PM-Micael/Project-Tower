	Question:
			- Do I want to spawn in turrets during scene runtime or just upgrade them?

	Notes
		- Tower tiers will work in layers and start with 3 walls
		- Player can set a "watchpoint" to somewhat control where the canons will shoot.

	- Figure out how I want to handle maps.
	- Perhaps make a test map.
	
	Notes
		- As your fort grows it opens up possebility for more pawn locations for difficulity

	- Data like fort tier number that is set in multiple nodes can be set in one place and reused.
	 -Attack should trigger the moment an enemy enters range and not just after cooldown
