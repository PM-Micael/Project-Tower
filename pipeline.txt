- Eneemies collide with tower (keep?)
- Add walls connecting the towers

2025-12-13	
	Question:
			- Do I want to spawn in turrets during scene runtime or just upgrade them?

2025-12-14
	Notes
		- Tower tiers will work in layers and start with 3 walls
		- Player can set a "watchpoint" to somewhat control where the canons will shoot.

	- Make waves and spawning work properly
	- Investigate the delay in canons shoting when round starts
	- Display current tier and round on the UI
	
	Notes
		- Skins would be cool.

	- Some restructuring of the enemy Scene might be needed as it riht now has "hitboxes" in multiple nodes

2025-12-22
	- Fix the attack time with new area hitbox collision
	- Check the fort_progression for when the wall is set if there are inconsistencies with the Parrent node and the collider node

	Notes
		- ON enemy, collision box should be smaller than the area hitbox
