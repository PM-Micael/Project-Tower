	- Refactor so that it is the fort that spawns all the turrets, core, etc
	
	Question:
			- Do I want to spawn in turrets during scene runtime or just upgrade them?

	- Decide on casing for functions. With an underscore at the start or not
	- Find an easy way to mach up the ColorRect and CollisionShape in their transform
	Notes
		- Tower tiers will work in layers and start with 3 walls
		- Player can set a "watchpoint" to somewhat control where the canons will shoot.
